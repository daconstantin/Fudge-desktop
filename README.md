# Fudge-desktop
Beautiful and feature full desktop enviroment based on JWM. Easy, automated and flexible integration between Web Applications, public api's, cloud services and desktop. Sensible lightweight default applications and settings. For convinience I'm designing this for Ubuntu/Debian at the moment. Suitable for low end hardware, netbooks, laptops single board computers, etc.
