# Fudge-desktop
Non-bloated, pretty and feature full desktop environment based on JWM. Easy, automated and flexible integration between Web Applications, public api's, cloud services and desktop. Sensible lightweight default applications and settings. At the moment for Ubuntu/Debian, but is easily made to work with other distributions too. Supporting the deb-packages just makes it more convinient to design and test. Suitable for low end hardware, netbooks, laptops -- flies with modern hardware!

Strong ntegration to web-applications, cloud services and public api's

Secondary desktop session for hardware accelerated media-center use, based around wayland and Firefox is planned. Single fullscreen browser should run decently on a Raspberry Pi 3B+.
